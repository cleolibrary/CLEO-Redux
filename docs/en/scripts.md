# Scripts

CLEO Redux supports [JavaScript](./javascript.md) (`*.js`) and [TypeScript](./typescript.md) (`*.ts`) scripts. In some games [compiled binary scripts](./compiled-scripts.md) (`*.cs`) in the SCM format are also supported.

[Refer to this page](https://github.com/cleolibrary/CLEO-Redux/wiki/Feature-Support-Matrix) for more information on which script types are supported in which games.
