# Scripts

## Adding a new script

Generally a script file (`.cs`, `.js`, `.ts`) should just be copied to the `CLEO` directory. Some scripts may require extra steps for installation. In case of any issues check the script documentation or ask its author.

[Complex JS scripts](./script-lifecycle.md#organizing-scripts) with dependencies may be distributed as folders with `index.js` or `index.ts` and other files in it. Copy such folders to the `CLEO` directory.

## Removing the script

Delete the script file from `CLEO` directory. Some scripts may require extra steps for undoing the installation. In case of any issues check the script documentation or ask its author.
