### Is there any difference from support of the classic games?

In short, yes. [See this page](https://github.com/cleolibrary/CLEO-Redux/wiki/Feature-Support-Matrix) for detail on what's supported and what's not.

### What commands/opcodes are available?

CLEO Redux supports all native commands provided by the game engine. You can find the list of all commands in the [Sanny Builder library](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/sa_unreal). 

In addition to that, CLEO Redux adds [new commands via plugins](https://library.sannybuilder.com/#/unknown_x64/script).

### How do I know what commands can I use in JavaScript?

After each game run, CLEO generates a `.d.ts` file in the `CLEO\.config` directory. It's called `gta3.d.ts`, `vc.d.ts` or `sa.d.ts` depending on the game. This file lists all supported functions and methods that you can use in JavaScript code.

To enable autocomplete in VS Code save your script file with `.ts` extension.

### Can I work with the game memory or call the game functions?

Yes, check the [Memory guide](using-memory-64.md).

### How do I compile CLEO scripts for the Triogy with Sanny Builder?

CLEO Redux provides limited support of compiled scripts (.CS) for the San Andreas: Definitive Edition only. It is recommended to write scripts using JavaScript or TypeScript.

To compile CLEO scripts for San Andreas: The Definitive Edition using Sanny Builer use SA Mobile mode.
